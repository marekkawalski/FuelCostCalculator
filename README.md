  <p>Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you go on holidays with your friends, you are their driver and all passengers cover diffrent distances?
Let's say that you drove three distances:
<ul>
  <li>To London</li>
   <li>Trip through London</li>
   <li>Back from London</li>
 </ul>
 To London, through London and back from London you drove with:
 <ul>
  <li>Matt</li>
  <li>Mark</li>
  <li>Pablo</li>
  <li>John</li>
 </ul>
 You all covered the same distance, so there is no trouble calculating that.
 What would happen if:
  <ul>
  <li>Matt came to London by train, so to London you drove with three passengers.</li>
  <li>Pablo was ill when you were sighsteeing London and he was unable to go.</li>
  <li>John had to come back earlier thus he came back home by plane.</li>
 </ul>
 In this situation, each passenger covered diffrent distance so they should pay accordingly to how many kilometers/miles they covered, 
 shouldn't they?
 At this moment, situation starts to get tricky because you have absolutely no idea how much your passengers should pay for fuel.
 Fortunately, this is where <strong>Fuel cost calculator</strong> comes at rescue. It can accurately calculate how much each passenger owes.
